### Task C: Product Package Counter

**Task:** You need to develop a program that counts the number of items that a hardware device scans to sort for boxing packages into cases. Each package scanned is two (2) products. Each case can only fit 50 product packages. Write a program that prints numbers from 2 to 50, counting by twos.

**Hint:** Loops

    Variables   Item = 2
                itemCount
                caseCount

    for Scan barcode itemCount === 50
        
        if item count is <= 50
            item + itemCount = itemCount
            command for robot to put item in case
        else
            robot close case
            move case on belt and bring in new case
            ++ casecount
